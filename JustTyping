I just wrote a short essay on Data Science. I wrote it in the form of a conversation. Perhaps it was "Useful Fiction" or a "Narrative" as [P.W. Singer](pwsinger.com) would title it. Maybe that is a stretch, but I infrequently write in the style of a Person-A-to-Person-B conversation.

That essay will publish in a couple of weeks. I doubt anyone of any significance will read it, but I have written it and one day can point to it and say, "Hey, I am on record as describing Data Science in those terms."

That might amount to something one day. I am not sure. Today I am again struggling with this idea that I have all these files entered in the computer with some on disk, some on Google (a lot on Google Drive) and so on. What if? What if Wordpress goes away? What if HostMonster goes away? How can I make HostMonster backups? How can I do that regularly? What is the use?

Well, there would be or might be much use in having weekly backups of Wordpress. And along we go.
